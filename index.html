          <h2>Who am I?</h2>

          <p>
            My name is Johnnie Zaharia, and I’m currently a Junior studying
            software engineering at NDSU. My goal with this degree is to pursue
            a career in application software development while applying the
            practical knowledge gained in my studies and work experiences. I’m
            passionate about learning how to use technology to improve the lives
            of others and solve widely-faced problems.

      <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
      <h4 class="text-center">Personal Background</h4>
      <p>
        I’m from a small town in southern Minnesota called Truman, which took up
        only one square mile of land and was home to about a thousand people,
        meaning I graduated with a grade size of only eight people. I have three
        sisters including my twin Gracie and two older sisters named Emily and
        Courtney. Growing up, I was always curious and was interested in
        learning more about nearly everything. I took a strong liking to math
        and different subjects that allowed me to analyze situations and
        problem-solve, diving deeper into those concepts by participating in
        different tech and STEM-related camps. After learning about what coding
        was and its basics, I felt I needed to know more. Around the age of 12,
        after self-learning HTML and CSS using resources on the internet I
        created my first sample website, which was a simple bakery website with
        an ordering form.
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Professional Background</h4>
      <p>
        Throughout high school and the beginning of college, I worked a variety
        of different food-service jobs. In multiple of these positions,
        including at Subway and Insomnia Cookies, my role was a Shift Lead. This
        meant that my job not only included the basic aspects of being an
        employee like serving the customers and completing orders, but also more
        important activities like handling money, tracking inventory, and
        maintaining customer satisfaction. I started my current position as a
        Research Assistant with NDSU’s ECE department and the USDA in May of
        2025. In this role, I work on agricultural sensor research and
        development. This means that I get to work with real clients to assess
        their needs and gather requirements, then work alongside my team to
        engineer and deliver effective and innovative solutions to the problems
        they face. I am planning to take another step toward my career goals
        with a summer internship at AGCO, where I will work in Software
        Requirements Testing.
      </p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Interests & Hobbies</h4>
      <p>
        I am always busy and looking forward to fun experiences outside of work
        and school. Some of my favorite hobbies include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>Hanging out with my family and friends –</span> With all of my
          sisters living in the Fargo-Moorhead area and a house with 5 other
          roommates, there are always people around to laugh or just chill with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Traveling –</span> I love to go to new places and see new
          things. Whether it’s a short road trip or a flight away from home, I’m
          always down for the ride. On my trips I love to hike, see breathtaking
          views, try new food, and learn about different cultures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Cooking & Baking –</span> I’ve loved both since I was just a
          kid, and I love trying out different recipes and flavors and sharing
          those with my loved ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Concerts –</span> Live music and events are always on my
          calendar. Seeing my favorite artists perform always makes for a good
          time with friends filled with great music and even better memories
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Volleyball -</span> I’ve played volleyball since I was and kid
          and all throughout high school. Now, I participate in a league with my
          oldest sister and we have games every week.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I also love to read during my free time or when traveling. Some of my
        favorite books include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Night Road by Kristin Hannah</li>
        <li>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</li>

                moving, and setting down an 8-pound radar unit. The radar will
                be used along sugar beet piles to scan and locate areas of
                rotting, which not only causes more rotting but also releases
                harmful chemicals into the air. I developed a schematic and
                tested it using a breadboard, then designed and assembled a
                printed circuit board (PCB), and finally made any necessary
                changes and further refined the product.

                in a compact but functional manner. This enclosure has a ridge
                for a battery pack on the bottom, a panel for mounting the PCB
                securely inside, and a sliding plexiglass side. It also has a
                mounting hole on the bottom for the electromagnet unit, an
                external power button, and external LEDs that indicate the
                board’s activity. This unit will be mounted to the bottom of a
                drone so that the user can remotely move objects like the radar
                unit.
